## Overview

Website should remain responsive and clean when resizing the viewport.

## Getting Started
Familiarize yourself with SMACSS. Once familiar follow TODO's listed on the index.HTML
Move CSS styling from provided modularize.css to appropriate SMACSS type CSS file.
Verify through live-server (or refreshing) that the webpage is responsive across multiple sizes, and MEDIA states are properly working.

## Architecture
HTML and CSS built for mobile first, utilizing media queries to control CSS rules depending on screen size.  CSS is organized using SMACSS mindset in seperate stylesheets for base, layout, modules, and state.
